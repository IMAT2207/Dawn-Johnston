# Completely Legitimately Sourced Goods

A system which vendors wholesale food products to trading businesses.


This system will vend wholesale food goods to traders.
A public facing web based front-end will house access to the database of stock, which customers can browse and filter to find products to purchase.

The customer can create their required traders’ account, which will store required business details. They will be able to collate an order of items under their traders’ account. It will be possible for the customer to view their previous orders, and modify their WIP orders.

A private sector of the web system will house controls for staff. This staff only section shows orders which have been placed and need completing, alongside tools for managing and monitoring stock levels and customer data
